Maybe it was a late night phone call with your mom. Or maybe it was with a stranger you now call a friend.\r\n\r\nNo matter who you’re talking to, great conversations are hard to forget. They ignite something between people that helps us understand each other and ourselves. They spark curiosity and shape opinions that we carry with us as we move forward. These moments can lead us many places and one thing is almost always certain; great conversations connect us. Challenge for Change is bringing these moments to the surface.\r\n\r\nWe are inviting people across the country to talk to each other – and more importantly – listen to each other’s stories, ideas and perspectives. We want to find the conversations that connect us, that break down barriers and shift points of view - and we’re bringing all of them to you.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be recording these conversations, and with your permission, some of them will be published as audio documentaries on our website and social media channels.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Cross-Canada Adventure</strong>\r\n\r\nOur team will be taking the train across the country all summer thanks to our partner VIA Rail Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Vancouver to Churchill to Halifax - and everywhere in between - we’ll be on board with recorders in hand, ready to listen. If you’re travelling by rail this summer and you see us on board, please come introduce yourself – we’d love to meet you and hear what you have to say. Think of this as a chance to connect, meet new people and tell <em>your</em> story.  You never know who might be sitting next to you or who you’ll meet at the next stop; it could be someone you have more in common with than you think.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_209" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-209 size-large" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="454" /> Catherine Phillips aboard the VIA Corridor train from Toronto to Montreal, chatting with travellers making their way across the country.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOur adventure has already started. We just finished our first trip from Toronto to Halifax and we heard some incredible stories along the way. We met a woman who sold her house to fund a trip around the world, high school sweethearts celebrating their retirement by travelling cross-country to visit their family, province by province. And a mother who lost her son and continues to thank him for teaching her what it means to really live.\r\n\r\nThat is the real thrill behind this project – you never know where the conversation will take you. There is something so remarkable about listening to them unfold and often witnessing a new level of connection and understanding. After just one trip, I’m hooked and can’t wait to get back on the train. I really hope you’ll join us for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\n<strong>Community listening events </strong>\r\n\r\nOur conversations keep rolling long after we step off the train.\r\n\r\nOur team will be collaborating with communities, organizations and advocates across the country, hosting listening events that put the microphone in <em>their</em> hands. This arm of the C4C project is all about forming deeper connections and engagement with the communities we visit. Together we create programs, workshops and listening events that serve the interests of each community. It’s an opportunity for our team to dig a little deeper and – with the community’s guidance – capture conversations that deepen our understanding of their particular perspectives and challenges. These conversations are already happening - we’ll be there to listen and learn.\r\n\r\n<strong>We’re already hard at work!</strong>\r\n\r\nThis project is driven by a small team of multi-media journalists brought together by our passion for storytelling and community engagement. We’re also pretty excited to travel coast to coast and learn more about this country and the people in it!\r\n\r\nAlthough we come from a diverse range of backgrounds, from print to documentary film, there’s one thing we definitely all agree on - the incredible impact of audio storytelling. We’ve been collecting conversations, listening to them together and we’re really excited to now share them with you.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_213" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-213" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" /> Media makers Maureen McEwan and Nadia Khamski deep in focus editing our first series of conversations.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter only a month together, our team is deep in production. We’ve captured some interesting conversations in Toronto, Ontario and now we’re ready to hear what the rest of the country has to say.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, C4C is a project about listening. We talk to each other every day, sharing bits of our lives with one another – the trials and the triumphs – but, how often are we actually listening? This is the challenge we’re asking you to accept.\r\n\r\nWe’re asking you to take the time to really listen to each other, think about the stories we’re capturing and publishing and challenge yourself to find the narratives that connect you to the people around you. We’re recording your conversations because we think they can be more than just memorable; they can lead to deeper understanding and spark new ideas about who we are.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_214" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-214" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_3-1024x777.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="516" /> We’re here to help get the conversation going - Maggie Parkhill facilitates a discussion between friends in Toronto, Ontario.[/caption]\r\n\r\nWe’re eager to hear what you have to say.

We are creating opportunities for Canadians across the country to talk—to listen—to one another. The conversations are one-on-one between family members, friends, neighbours, travelling companions and total strangers.</span>\r\n\r\nParticipants talk about a whole range of topics--love, loss, belonging, challenges. At times, the topics are completely left up to the participants and other times, questions are suggested or defined through workshops with the community.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/220377836\r\n\r\nYou will find the conversations are often deeply personal, emotional, funny. We hope that listening to them is like an experience you may have had in a coffee shop where you’ve stopped checking your feeds or reading your book because the conversation at the next table is so darn interesting. We also hope you learn something too.\r\n\r\nWe facilitate, then record the conversations and create audio-visual media from the ones that resonate most. The media is distributed back into the community and nationally, to a broad audience. All the conversations we record will become part of a national archive available to all Canadians on the National Film Board’s website, NFB.ca\r\n<h2 class="p1">Why Conversations</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to think of a more divisive time in our history. Distrust has been fomented by the Internet which channels us into our echo chambers and is awash in misinformation. Anonymous haters are thriving there, encouraged by politicians who are pitting people and groups against each other. Civil political discourse seems like a notion from another time. </span>\r\n\r\nWe’re in a conversation crisis.\r\n\r\nIf we aren’t talking and listening to each other, we aren’t going to find common ground or solutions to our pressing social challenges.\r\n<h2>Levels of engagement</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">C4C engages with Canadians and communities on a number of levels.</span>\r\n\r\nThe first level is through conversations we are recording on VIA Rail trains and in communities along the way. Our team will be travelling across Canada working with passengers and participants who wish to have their conversations heard.\r\n\r\nThe second level involves deeper engagement with a community. We partner with local organizations and together, design a program to serve their community\'s particular interests and needs. This engagement usually involves workshops, recording and distribution of edited conversations back into the community to provoke deeper conversation.\r\n\r\nThen, where there is need—where there is traction with a community—we continue working with them for a prolonged period of time. The community and local support networks take the lead in what becomes an open-ended process of engagement and media-making to provoke dialogue and advance solutions. Our role is one of support and facilitation based on the belief that communities know what is wrong and they know how to fix it.\r\n\r\n<b>Our current Series is a collaboration with youth in foster care in the Vancouver area.</b>\r\n<h2>Impact</h2>\r\nWe believe listening deeply to each other\'s stories and experiences can build bridges between individuals and communities. It can lead to some or all of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Deeper understanding of others.</li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shift in thinking about something (changed minds).</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased sense of belonging or decreased sense of isolation.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse groups working together.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New relationships fostered.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased, more nuanced discourse about belonging and inclusion.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stronger will to action.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life is better in tangible ways.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe will know these changes have happened through a combination of surveys, follow-up surveys and metrics.', 'About', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'about', '', '', '2017-06-06 18:09:56', '2017-06-06 18:09:56', '', 0, 'http://192.168.0.99:8888/c4c/?page_id=13', 3, 'page', '', 0),

After meeting up early that morning at Toronto’s Union Station, we bonded over cups of coffee from a pop-up cafe, preparing ourselves for what was sure to be an unforgettable trip.\r\n\r\nFrom coast-to-coast, C4C collects conversations between people whose life experiences are as different from your own as they are similar. Whether speaking of significant loss, childhood, or feminism, each story is woven together by an awareness of the past and shared sense of hopefulness for the future.\r\n\r\nLast week, the railroad was our soundtrack, the eastern Canadian landscape the perfect backdrop, and the constant sway a gentle reminder of the distance we all were from home. We wouldn’t stop swaying even after we stepped on solid ground, arriving in Halifax the following day and setting out toward the Dalhousie University residence we would call home that night—Shirreff Hall.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_191" align="alignleft" width="225"]<img class="wp-image-191 size-medium" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/DAmnxDAXkAARQS4-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /> Brittany (front) and Catherine on the train to Halifax, Nova Scotia[/caption]\r\n\r\nAs we travelled, Brittany and I grew accustomed to trading our own stories, and you won’t be surprised that two women journalists found a common thread. On several occasions we were even tempted to turn the mics on ourselves—sharing our perspectives as witnesses of this time in history, our feelings on the tenuousness of reproductive and human rights, and recalling just how deeply affected we both were by last year’s U.S. election results.\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t take long for conversations to turn political when women get together these days.\r\n\r\nIn January, millions of women and allies took to the streets to protest the inauguration of President Trump, prompted by a call to action that shook a false assumption that the fight for women’s equality was won long ago. The original Women’s March on Washington, which inspired millions to march in sister rallies around the world, drew over half a million people alone.\r\n\r\nThe morning of our departure, packed up, checked out, and heading to the Halifax train station, a plaque in the Shirreff Hall lobby caught our attention. To our surprise, this was exclusively a women’s residence until 2005. The irony was not lost on us.\r\n<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>\r\nI overheard Nancy, Linda, and Pearl on the way home from Halifax. It was clear right away that they had known each other for years, laughing and joking as old friends with familial comfort tend to do. Linda and Nancy had been friends since childhood, growing up under the watchful eye of Linda’s mother, Pearl. Later that night, Nancy would try to remember a time in her life  that the two women hadn’t been a part of.\r\n\r\nWhen we met, the three were bent over <em>The Chronicle Herald</em>, stuck on an article about Joyce Carter, President and CEO of Halifax International Airport. “A woman CEO!” they marveled. As three women ranging from their mid-sixties to nineties, it wasn’t a position they were used to seeing a woman hold.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_199" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-199 size-large" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_2106-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="453" /> From Left to right: Nancy, Linda, and Pearl on their way to Quebec[/caption]\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">Our conversation with the three women poured into the next day—love, family, and paving your way—by the end, Brittany and I felt like we had just spoken to a supportive troupe of aunts rather than a trio of strangers. They cheered us on in our careers and congratulated us on our positions at C4C, which I should mention is produced entirely by a small team of women.</p>\r\nOur first journey ended in Montreal the following day. Lingering on the platform, we quickly spotted Nancy, Linda, and Pearl. “Good luck,” they told us. “You girls are going to have a great summer.” We couldn’t help but agree.\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-283436858-290767787/linda-nancy-pearl', 'Meeting Nancy, Linda, and Pearl', 'You never say this is what I want to do....you’re always thinking what is my mom going to think…', 'trash', 'open', 'open', '', 'meeting-nancy-linda-and-pearl__trashed', '', '', '2017-06-05 18:55:56', '2017-06-05 18:55:56', '', 0, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/?p=55', 0, 'post', '', 0),

We are creating opportunities for Canadians across the country to talk—to listen—to one another. The conversations are one-on-one between family members, friends, neighbours, travelling companions and total strangers.</span>\n\nParticipants talk about a whole range of topics--love, loss, belonging, challenges. At times, the topics are completely left up to the participants and other times, questions are suggested or defined through workshops with the community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou will find the conversations are often deeply personal, emotional, funny. We hope that listening to them is like an experience you may have had in a coffee shop where you’ve stopped checking your feeds or reading your book because the conversation at the next table is so darn interesting. We also hope you learn something too.\n\nWe facilitate, then record the conversations and create audio-visual media from the ones that resonate most. The media is distributed back into the community and nationally, to a broad audience. All the conversations we record will become part of a national archive available to all Canadians on the National Film Board’s website, NFB.ca\n<h2 class="p1">Why Conversations</h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to think of a more divisive time in our history. Distrust has been fomented by the Internet which channels us into our echo chambers and is awash in misinformation. Anonymous haters are thriving there, encouraged by politicians who are pitting people and groups against each other. Civil political discourse seems like a notion from another time. </span>\n\nWe’re in a conversation crisis.\n\nIf we aren’t talking and listening to each other, we aren’t going to find common ground or solutions to our pressing social challenges.\n<h2>Levels of engagement</h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">C4C engages with Canadians and communities on a number of levels.</span>\n\nThe first level is through conversations we are recording on VIA Rail trains and in communities along the way. Our team will be travelling across Canada working with passengers and participants who wish to have their conversations heard.\n\nThe second level involves deeper engagement with a community. We partner with local organizations and together, design a program to serve their community\'s particular interests and needs. This engagement usually involves workshops, recording and distribution of edited conversations back into the community to provoke deeper conversation.\n\nWhere there is need—where there is traction with a community—we continue working with them for a prolonged period of time. The community and local support networks take the lead in what becomes an open-ended process of engagement and media-making to provoke dialogue and advance solutions. Our role is one of support and facilitation based on the belief that communities know what is wrong and they know how to fix it.\n\n<b>Our current Series is a collaboration with youth in foster care in the Vancouver area.</b>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\nWe believe listening deeply to each other\'s stories and experiences can build bridges between individuals and communities. It can lead to some or all of the following:\n\n-deeper understanding of others\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-shift in thinking about something (changed minds) </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-increased sense of belonging or decreased sense of isolation</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-diverse groups working together </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-new relationships fostered</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-increased, more nuanced discourse about belonging and inclusion</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-stronger will to action </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">-life is better in tangible ways </span>\n\nWe will know these changes have happened through a combination of surveys, follow up surveys and metrics.', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '13-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-06-01 16:46:22', '2017-06-01 16:46:22', '', 13, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/13-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

It is the brainchild of The MacMillan Family Foundation, Inspirit Foundation and The National Film Board of Canada (NFB).</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is inspired by NFB’s groundbreaking program which ran from 1967 to 1980. The original<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Challenge for Change / Société Nouvelle</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>brought together filmmakers, community organizers, and citizens to use participatory media-making as a tool to engage marginalized groups and address poverty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Through the process, the people of Fogo organized and persuaded the government to support a fishing cooperative and marketing board.”</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The Fogo Process</em> was the signature project of the original<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><em>Change for Change</em>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The island off Newfoundland was reeling from the collapse of the fishery and relocation was looming. Twenty-seven films were created by filmmaker Colin Low and the community and shared with other communities and government officials. Through the process, the people of Fogo organized and persuaded the government to support a fishing cooperative and marketing board. Together they rebuilt their economy and were able to remain on Fogo Island.</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The<em> Fogo Process</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a beacon for us. We are seeking those same levels of impact: stronger communities and a tangible improvement in people’s lives.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class="p1">Mission</h2>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through listening and the democratic power of media, <em>Challenge for Change</em> will help build the country we want by strengthening relationships between people and communities.</span></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We envision communities where people have the power to make change and create opportunity for themselves and others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">Guiding Principles</span></h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>C4C is about deep, genuine listening.</li>\r\n 	<li>C4C takes time to build relationships.</li>\r\n 	<li>C4C is creating media for change with communities rather than about them.</li>\r\n 	<li>Communities influence all aspects of C4C’s activities.</li>\r\n 	<li>C4C listens to all Canadians with a special focus on youth, newcomers and Indigenous peoples.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2 class="p1">What We Do</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversations are at the heart of C4C. We are creating opportunities for Canadians across the country to talk—to listen—to one another. The conversations are one-on-one between family members, friends, neighbours, travelling companions and total strangers.</span>\r\n\r\nParticipants talk about a whole range of topics--love, loss, belonging, challenges. At times, the topics are completely left up to the participants and other times, questions are suggested or defined through workshops with the community.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/219129244\r\n\r\nYou will find the conversations are often deeply personal, emotional, funny. We hope that listening to them is like an experience you may have had in a coffee shop where you’ve stopped checking your feeds or reading your book because the conversation at the next table is so darn interesting. We also hope you learn something too.\r\n\r\nWe facilitate, then record the conversations and create audio-visual media from the ones that resonate most. The media is distributed back into the community and nationally, to a broad audience. All the conversations we record will become part of a national archive available to all Canadians on the National Film Board’s website, NFB.ca\r\n<h2 class="p1">Why Conversations</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to think of a more divisive time in our history. Distrust has been fomented by the Internet which channels us into our echo chambers and is awash in misinformation. Anonymous haters are thriving there, encouraged by politicians who are pitting people and groups against each other. Civil political discourse seems like a notion from another time. </span>\r\n\r\nWe’re in a conversation crisis.\r\n\r\nIf we aren’t talking and listening to each other, we aren’t going to find common ground or solutions to our pressing social challenges.\r\n<h2>Levels of engagement</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">C4C engages with Canadians and communities on a number of levels.</span>\r\n\r\nThe first level is through conversations we are recording on VIA Rail trains and in communities along the way. Our team will be travelling across Canada working with passengers and participants who wish to have their conversations heard.\r\n\r\nThe second level involves deeper engagement with a community. We partner with local organizations and together, design a program to serve their community\'s particular interests and needs. This engagement usually involves workshops, recording and distribution of edited conversations back into the community to provoke deeper conversation.\r\n\r\nThen, where there is need—where there is traction with a community—we continue working with them for a prolonged period of time. The community and local support networks take the lead in what becomes an open-ended process of engagement and media-making to provoke dialogue and advance solutions. Our role is one of support and facilitation based on the belief that communities know what is wrong and they know how to fix it.\r\n\r\n<b>Our current Series is a collaboration with youth in foster care in the Vancouver area.</b>\r\n<h2>Impact</h2>\r\nWe believe listening deeply to each other\'s stories and experiences can build bridges between individuals and communities.

A downpour with thunderstorm-after-thunderstorm and flood warnings city-wide. I was at a bus terminal once again, sitting on top of my two black suitcases and plagued with doubt.\n\nOn paper, Challenge for Change (C4C) sounded terrific.  C4C aims to engage Canadians across the country in conversation. I was joining a team of journalists and facilitators who were working and travelling on VIA trains all summer. Thrilling, right?\n\nI’ll admit, it took me a few days to dry off and appreciate the opportunity.\n\nMore specifically, I think it took Louanne and Jenni.\n\nLouann and Jenni are a mother-daughter duo. They participated in C4C out west by having a deeply personal conversation with one of our facilitators present to record it. We hail from the same area – British Columbia – but my experience of home was much different. In the conversation, I learned that Jenni was put into foster care in her early teens due to several challenges – housing, mental health supports, etc. While they talk, Louann answers many of her daughter’s unresolved questions about life, loss, love and what led her into foster care.\n\nBrielle Morgan was the conversation’s facilitator. Brielle is a journalist at Discourse Media, which is C4C’s partner in Vancouver, BC (Check out her journal entries too!). She came out to train our team in May and, with Jenni and Louann’s permission, Brielle trusted their story to us.\n\nThe team was editing different conversations – myself and Karissa, another C4C member, decided to edit Louann and Jenni’s conversation.\n\nAnother confession: I had no clue what their story was about at first. I had arrived five minutes late to work (yes, to get a coffee – I’m sorry) I snuck into our morning meeting. I knew we were editing all day but I missed our Director’s description and summary of the conversations. When I sat down at the computer after the meeting, I picked a file at random.\n\nAnd then I was glued to the computer all day. The conversation between mother and daughter was mesmerizing and powerful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJenni and Louann talked about their relationship and experiences and the conversation made me question some of my deeper assumptions. And that was <em>their</em> goal. That’s what these women wanted to do. With me, they achieved that tenfold. They shared a journey that was profound, and painful, - but mostly? Inspiring. We’ve never met, and likely never will, but I am grateful for their story.\n\nDespite having the same original recording, Karissa and I came out of the edit room with different focuses for Jenni and Louann’s story. While at first it presented a challenge, I think, in the end, it strengthened the piece. Together, we crafted a dynamic story that captures Louann and Jenni’s experience - hopefully, as they would have wanted. (As a note: We are hoping to share this story with you soon. Jenni is currently “aging out” of government care so we are waiting to confirm permission from her official caregiver prior to publishing). Other C4C colleagues helped with music selections and gave guidance on the production. Overall, it was a team effort and one which made me understand the nature of this project more. It is going to be about relationships, from start-to-finish, sound-check to story post.\n\nOf course, there will be light, humorous, down-right-bizarre moments and plenty of joy. But there will also be painful reflections and explorations. We’re really asking people to bare their souls, if they’re willing so that other Canadians can share their journeys and deepen their understanding of life experiences different from their own. And maybe, just maybe, perspectives will shift and minds will change about something. The only thing that comes with that is gratitude, for me.\n\nIn their conversation, Jenni and Louann mention the idea of “Level 10” – or an excellent, top-notch score it seems.

Maybe it was a late night phone call with your mom. Or maybe it was with a stranger you now call a friend.\r\n\r\nNo matter who you’re talking to, great conversations are hard to forget. They ignite something between people that helps us understand each other and ourselves. They spark curiosity and shape opinions that we carry with us as we move forward. These moments can lead us many places and one thing is almost always certain; great conversations connect us.\r\n\r\nChallenge for Change is bringing these moments to the surface.\r\n\r\nWe are inviting people across the country to talk to each other – and more importantly – listen to each other’s stories, ideas and perspectives. We want to find the conversations that connect us, that break down barriers and shift points of view - and we’re bringing all of them to you.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be recording these conversations, and with your permission, some of them will be published as audio documentaries on our website and social media channels.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Cross-Canada Adventure</strong>\r\n\r\nOur team will be taking the train across the country all summer thanks to our partner VIA Rail Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Vancouver to Churchill to Halifax - and everywhere in between - we’ll be on board with recorders in hand, ready to listen. If you’re travelling by rail this summer and you see us on board, please come introduce yourself – we’d love to meet you and hear what you have to say. Think of this as a chance to connect, meet new people and tell <em>your</em> story.  You never know who might be sitting next to you or who you’ll meet at the next stop; it could be someone you have more in common with than you think.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_209" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-209 size-large" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="454" /> Catherine Phillips aboard the VIA Corridor train from Toronto to Montreal, chatting with travellers making their way across the country.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOur adventure has already started. We just finished our first trip from Toronto to Halifax and we heard some incredible stories along the way. We met a woman who sold her house to fund a trip around the world, high school sweethearts celebrating their retirement by travelling cross-country to visit their family, province by province. And a mother who lost her son and continues to thank him for teaching her what it means to really live.\r\n\r\nThat is the real thrill behind this project – you never know where the conversation will take you. There is something so remarkable about listening to them unfold and often witnessing a new level of connection and understanding.\r\n\r\nAfter just one trip, I’m hooked and can’t wait to get back on the train. I really hope you’ll join us for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\n<strong>Community listening events </strong>\r\n\r\nOur conversations keep rolling long after we step off the train.\r\n\r\nOur team will be collaborating with communities, organizations and advocates across the country, hosting listening events that put the microphone in <em>their</em> hands. This arm of the C4C project is all about forming deeper connections and engagement with the communities we visit. Together we create programs, workshops and listening events that serve the interests of each community. It’s an opportunity for our team to dig a little deeper and – with the community’s guidance – capture conversations that deepen our understanding of their particular perspectives and challenges.\r\n\r\nThese conversations are already happening - we’ll be there to listen and learn.\r\n\r\n<strong>We’re already hard at work!</strong>\r\n\r\nThis project is driven by a small team of multi-media journalists brought together by our passion for storytelling and community engagement. We’re also pretty excited to travel coast to coast and learn more about this country and the people in it!\r\n\r\nAlthough we come from a diverse range of backgrounds, from print to documentary film, there’s one thing we definitely all agree on - the incredible impact of audio storytelling. We’ve been collecting conversations, listening to them together and we’re really excited to now share them with you.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_213" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-213" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" /> Media makers Maureen McEwan and Nadia Khamski deep in focus editing our first series of conversations.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter only a month together, our team is deep in production. We’ve captured some interesting conversations in Toronto, Ontario and now we’re ready to hear what the rest of the country has to say.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, C4C is a project about listening. We talk to each other every day, sharing bits of our lives with one another – the trials and the triumphs – but, how often are we actually listening? This is the challenge we’re asking you to accept.\r\n\r\nWe’re asking you to take the time to really listen to each other, think about the stories we’re capturing and publishing and challenge yourself to find the narratives that connect you to the people around you. We’re recording your conversations because we think they can be more than just memorable; they can lead to deeper understanding and spark new ideas about who we are.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_214" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-214" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_3-1024x777.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="516" /> We’re here to help get the conversation going - Maggie Parkhill facilitates a discussion between friends in Toronto, Ontario.[/caption]\r\n\r\nWe’re eager to hear what you have to say.

Maybe it was a late night phone call with your mom. Or maybe it was with a stranger you now call a friend.\r\n\r\nNo matter who you’re talking to, great conversations are hard to forget. They ignite something between people that helps us understand each other and ourselves. They spark curiosity and shape opinions that we carry with us as we move forward. These moments can lead us many places and one thing is almost always certain; great conversations connect us. Challenge for Change is bringing these moments to the surface.\r\n\r\nWe are inviting people across the country to talk to each other – and more importantly – listen to each other’s stories, ideas and perspectives. We want to find the conversations that connect us, that break down barriers and shift points of view - and we’re bringing all of them to you.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be recording these conversations, and with your permission, some of them will be published as audio documentaries on our website and social media channels.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Cross-Canada Adventure</strong>\r\n\r\nOur team will be taking the train across the country all summer thanks to our partner VIA Rail Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Vancouver to Churchill to Halifax - and everywhere in between - we’ll be on board with recorders in hand, ready to listen. If you’re travelling by rail this summer and you see us on board, please come introduce yourself – we’d love to meet you and hear what you have to say. Think of this as a chance to connect, meet new people and tell <em>your</em> story.  You never know who might be sitting next to you or who you’ll meet at the next stop; it could be someone you have more in common with than you think.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_209" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-209 size-large" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="454" /> Catherine Phillips aboard the VIA Corridor train from Toronto to Montreal, chatting with travellers making their way across the country.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOur adventure has already started. We just finished our first trip from Toronto to Halifax and we heard some incredible stories along the way. We met a woman who sold her house to fund a trip around the world, high school sweethearts celebrating their retirement by travelling cross-country to visit their family, province by province. And a mother who lost her son and continues to thank him for teaching her what it means to really live.\r\n\r\nThat is the real thrill behind this project – you never know where the conversation will take you. There is something so remarkable about listening to them unfold and often witnessing a new level of connection and understanding. After just one trip, I’m hooked and can’t wait to get back on the train. I really hope you’ll join us for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\n<strong>Community listening events </strong>\r\n\r\nOur conversations keep rolling long after we step off the train.\r\n\r\nOur team will be collaborating with communities, organizations and advocates across the country, hosting listening events that put the microphone in <em>their</em> hands. This arm of the C4C project is all about forming deeper connections and engagement with the communities we visit. Together we create programs, workshops and listening events that serve the interests of each community. It’s an opportunity for our team to dig a little deeper and – with the community’s guidance – capture conversations that deepen our understanding of their particular perspectives and challenges.\r\n\r\nThese conversations are already happening - we’ll be there to listen and learn.\r\n\r\n<strong>We’re already hard at work!</strong>\r\n\r\nThis project is driven by a small team of multi-media journalists brought together by our passion for storytelling and community engagement. We’re also pretty excited to travel coast to coast and learn more about this country and the people in it!\r\n\r\nAlthough we come from a diverse range of backgrounds, from print to documentary film, there’s one thing we definitely all agree on - the incredible impact of audio storytelling. We’ve been collecting conversations, listening to them together and we’re really excited to now share them with you.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_213" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-213" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" /> Media makers Maureen McEwan and Nadia Khamski deep in focus editing our first series of conversations.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter only a month together, our team is deep in production.

(233, 6, '2017-06-05 18:19:12', '2017-06-05 18:19:12', 'A few weeks ago, it was a question I was asking myself. Toronto had rain. A downpour with thunderstorm-after-thunderstorm and flood warnings city-wide. I was at a bus terminal once again, sitting on top of my two black suitcases and plagued with doubt.\r\n\r\nOn paper, Challenge for Change (C4C) sounded terrific.  C4C aims to engage Canadians across the country in conversation. I was joining a team of journalists and facilitators who were working and travelling on VIA trains all summer. Thrilling, right?\r\n\r\nI’ll admit, it took me a few days to dry off and appreciate the opportunity.  More specifically, I think it took Louanne and Jenni.\r\n\r\nLouann and Jenni are a mother-daughter duo. They participated in C4C out west by having a deeply personal conversation with one of our facilitators present to record it. We hail from the same area – British Columbia – but my experience of home was much different. In the conversation, I learned that Jenni was put into foster care in her early teens due to several challenges – housing, mental health supports, etc. While they talk, Louann answers many of her daughter’s unresolved questions about life, loss, love and what led her into foster care.\r\n\r\nBrielle Morgan was the conversation’s facilitator. Brielle is a journalist at Discourse Media, which is C4C’s partner in Vancouver, BC (Check out her journal entries too!). She came out to train our team in May and, with Jenni and Louann’s permission, Brielle trusted their story to us.\r\n\r\nThe team was editing different conversations – myself and Karissa, another C4C member, decided to edit Louann and Jenni’s conversation. Another confession: I had no clue what their story was about at first. I had arrived five minutes late to work (yes, to get a coffee – I’m sorry) and I snuck into our morning meeting. I knew we were editing all day but I missed our Director’s description and summary of the conversations. When I sat down at the computer after the meeting, I picked a file at random. And then I was glued to the computer all day. The conversation between mother and daughter was mesmerizing and powerful.\r\n\r\nJenni and Louann talked about their relationship and experiences and the conversation made me question some of my deeper assumptions. And that was <em>their</em> goal. That’s what these women wanted to do. With me, they achieved that tenfold. They shared a journey that was profound, and painful, - but mostly? Inspiring. We’ve never met, and likely never will, but I am grateful for their story.\r\n\r\nDespite having the same original recording, Karissa and I came out of the edit room with different focuses for Jenni and Louann’s story. While at first it presented a challenge, I think, in the end, it strengthened the piece. Together, we crafted a dynamic story that captures Louann and Jenni’s experience - hopefully, as they would have wanted. (As a note: We are hoping to share this story with you soon. Jenni is currently “aging out” of government care so we are waiting to confirm permission from her official caregiver prior to publishing). Other C4C colleagues helped with music selections and gave guidance on the production. Overall, it was a team effort and one which made me understand the nature of this project more. It is going to be about relationships, from start-to-finish, sound-check to story post.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be light, humorous, down-right-bizarre moments and plenty of joy. But there will also be painful reflections and explorations. We’re really asking people to bare their souls, if they’re willing so that other Canadians can share their journeys and deepen their understanding of life experiences different from their own. And maybe, just maybe, perspectives will shift and minds will change about something. The only thing that comes with that is gratitude, for me.\r\n\r\nIn their conversation, Jenni and Louann mention the idea of “Level 10” – or an excellent, top-notch score it seems.

Maybe it was a late night phone call with your mom. Or maybe it was with a stranger you now call a friend.\r\n\r\nNo matter who you’re talking to, great conversations are hard to forget. They ignite something between people that helps us understand each other and ourselves. They spark curiosity and shape opinions that we carry with us as we move forward. These moments can lead us many places and one thing is almost always certain; great conversations connect us. Challenge for Change is bringing these moments to the surface.\r\n\r\nWe are inviting people across the country to talk to each other – and more importantly – listen to each other’s stories, ideas and perspectives. We want to find the conversations that connect us, that break down barriers and shift points of view - and we’re bringing all of them to you.\r\n\r\nWe’ll be recording these conversations, and with your permission, some of them will be published as audio documentaries on our website and social media channels.\r\n\r\n<strong>A Cross-Canada Adventure</strong>\r\n\r\nOur team will be taking the train across the country all summer thanks to our partner VIA Rail Canada.\r\n\r\nFrom Vancouver to Churchill to Halifax - and everywhere in between - we’ll be on board with recorders in hand, ready to listen. If you’re travelling by rail this summer and you see us on board, please come introduce yourself – we’d love to meet you and hear what you have to say. Think of this as a chance to connect, meet new people and tell <em>your</em> story.  You never know who might be sitting next to you or who you’ll meet at the next stop; it could be someone you have more in common with than you think.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_209" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="wp-image-209 size-large" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="454" /> Catherine Phillips aboard the VIA Corridor train from Toronto to Montreal, chatting with travellers making their way across the country.[/caption]\r\n\r\nOur adventure has already started. We just finished our first trip from Toronto to Halifax and we heard some incredible stories along the way. We met a woman who sold her house to fund a trip around the world, high school sweethearts celebrating their retirement by travelling cross-country to visit their family, province by province. And a mother who lost her son and continues to thank him for teaching her what it means to really live.\r\n\r\nThat is the real thrill behind this project – you never know where the conversation will take you. There is something so remarkable about listening to them unfold and often witnessing a new level of connection and understanding. After just one trip, I’m hooked and can’t wait to get back on the train. I really hope you’ll join us for the rest of the journey.\r\n\r\n<strong>Community listening events </strong>\r\n\r\nOur conversations keep rolling long after we step off the train.\r\n\r\nOur team will be collaborating with communities, organizations and advocates across the country, hosting listening events that put the microphone in <em>their</em> hands. This arm of the C4C project is all about forming deeper connections and engagement with the communities we visit. Together we create programs, workshops and listening events that serve the interests of each community. It’s an opportunity for our team to dig a little deeper and – with the community’s guidance – capture conversations that deepen our understanding of their particular perspectives and challenges. These conversations are already happening - we’ll be there to listen and learn.\r\n\r\n<strong>We’re already hard at work!</strong>\r\n\r\nThis project is driven by a small team of multi-media journalists brought together by our passion for storytelling and community engagement. We’re also pretty excited to travel coast to coast and learn more about this country and the people in it!\r\n\r\nAlthough we come from a diverse range of backgrounds, from print to documentary film, there’s one thing we definitely all agree on - the incredible impact of audio storytelling. We’ve been collecting conversations, listening to them together and we’re really excited to now share them with you.\r\n\r\n[caption id="attachment_213" align="aligncenter" width="680"]<img class="size-large wp-image-213" src="http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/journal_photo_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="510" /> Media makers Maureen McEwan and Nadia Khamski deep in focus editing our first series of conversations.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\nAfter only a month together, our team is deep in production.

(241, 7, '2017-06-05 18:48:01', '2017-06-05 18:48:01', 'A few weeks ago, it was a question I was asking myself. Toronto had rain. A downpour with thunderstorm-after-thunderstorm and flood warnings city-wide. I was at a bus terminal once again, sitting on top of my two black suitcases and plagued with doubt.\r\n\r\nOn paper, Challenge for Change (C4C) sounded terrific.  C4C aims to engage Canadians across the country in conversation. I was joining a team of journalists and facilitators who were working and travelling on VIA trains all summer. Thrilling, right?\r\n\r\nI’ll admit, it took me a few days to dry off and appreciate the opportunity.  More specifically, I think it took Louann and Jenni.\r\n\r\nLouann and Jenni are a mother-daughter duo. They participated in C4C out west by having a deeply personal conversation with one of our facilitators present to record it. We hail from the same area – British Columbia – but my experience of home was much different. In the conversation, I learned that Jenni was put into foster care in her early teens due to several challenges – housing, mental health supports, etc. While they talk, Louann answers many of her daughter’s unresolved questions about life, loss, love and what led her into foster care.\r\n\r\nBrielle Morgan was the conversation’s facilitator. Brielle is a journalist at Discourse Media, which is C4C’s partner in Vancouver, BC (Check out her journal entries too!). She came out to train our team in May and, with Jenni and Louann’s permission, Brielle trusted their story to us.\r\n\r\nThe team was editing different conversations – myself and Karissa, another C4C member, decided to edit Louann and Jenni’s conversation. Another confession: I had no clue what their story was about at first. I had arrived five minutes late to work (yes, to get a coffee – I’m sorry) and I snuck into our morning meeting. I knew we were editing all day but I missed our Director’s description and summary of the conversations. When I sat down at the computer after the meeting, I picked a file at random. And then I was glued to the computer all day. The conversation between mother and daughter was mesmerizing and powerful.\r\n\r\nJenni and Louann talked about their relationship and experiences and the conversation made me question some of my deeper assumptions. And that was <em>their</em> goal. That’s what these women wanted to do. With me, they achieved that tenfold. They shared a journey that was profound, and painful, - but mostly? Inspiring. We’ve never met, and likely never will, but I am grateful for their story.\r\n<blockquote>It is going to be about relationships, from start-to-finish, sound-check to story post.</blockquote>\r\nDespite having the same original recording, Karissa and I came out of the edit room with different focuses for Jenni and Louann’s story. While at first it presented a challenge, I think, in the end, it strengthened the piece. Together, we crafted a dynamic story that captures Louann and Jenni’s experience - hopefully, as they would have wanted. (As a note: We are hoping to share this story with you soon. Jenni is currently “aging out” of government care so we are waiting to confirm permission from her official caregiver prior to publishing). Other C4C colleagues helped with music selections and gave guidance on the production. Overall, it was a team effort and one which made me understand the nature of this project more. It is going to be about relationships, from start-to-finish, sound-check to story post.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be light, humorous, down-right-bizarre moments and plenty of joy. But there will also be painful reflections and explorations. We’re really asking people to bare their souls, if they’re willing so that other Canadians can share their journeys and deepen their understanding of life experiences different from their own. And maybe, just maybe, perspectives will shift and minds will change about something. The only thing that comes with that is gratitude, for me.\r\n\r\nIn their conversation, Jenni and Louann mention the idea of “Level 10” – or an excellent, top-notch score it seems. So whatever our “Level 10” might be as a C4C team, I think we should strive for it every day.', 'Why C4C?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '205-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-06-05 18:48:01', '2017-06-05 18:48:01', '', 205, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/205-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Our partner, Discourse Media, spoke with youth, social workers and Métis leaders about Alex’s story and the lack of permanency for kids in care. </b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Embed video: Discourse Media credit. </b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When youth in foster care turn 19, they ‘age out’ which means they have to find their own place to live, a job or they have to arrange to go back to school. They are on their own with little support. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the devastating, inter-generational effects of colonial, racist policies, Indigenous kids are  overrepresented in the foster system. A recent report in BC states that more than 55 per cent of youth in care in the province are Indigenous, despite the fact that Indigenous children make up only eight per cent of B.C.’s total child population.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our child welfare system is bubbling over with stories, really important stories, but you probably haven’t heard many of them. Because of privacy laws. Because of our history of colonization and the resulting loss of trust. Because these systems are incredibly complex and hard to report on.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The stories that are told tend to be cyclical: A child in government care dies and everyone scrambles to pin the blame on someone – birth parents, foster parents, social workers, and so on. Months later, when the watchdog responsible for policing child welfare releases a report, there’s a flurry of media coverage—as there was in Alex’s case--and then everything goes quiet. In the space between those stories - about death and systemic failure - you’ll find very few uplifting stories.        </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth in and from “care” tell us “</span><a href="https://medium.com/discourse-media/nothing-about-us-without-us-what-are-the-best-practices-for-media-reporting-on-youth-welfare-af67819f3907#.om7d1s7xb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this deficit of hope” has an impact on them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><b>Many see media as a barrier to positive change, rather than a catalyst for it.</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how can we, as media makers, better serve people impacted by child welfare systems? </span>\n\n<b>We have to meet people “where they are.”</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Together with community partners, we developed a plan to make space for people to share stories that are too often side-stepped or silenced.</span>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this series, we will explore what we’ve heard from the people inside this community.

(259, 2, '2017-06-05 21:52:22', '2017-06-05 21:52:22', '&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, it was a question I was asking myself. Toronto had rain. A downpour with thunderstorm-after-thunderstorm and flood warnings city-wide. I was at a bus terminal once again, sitting on top of my two black suitcases and plagued with doubt.\r\n\r\nOn paper, Challenge for Change (C4C) sounded terrific.  C4C aims to engage Canadians across the country in conversation. I was joining a team of journalists and facilitators who were working and travelling on VIA trains all summer. Thrilling, right?\r\n\r\nI’ll admit, it took me a few days to dry off and appreciate the opportunity.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, I think it took Louanne and Jenni.\r\n\r\nLouann and Jenni are a mother-daughter duo. They participated in C4C out west by having a deeply personal conversation with one of our facilitators present to record it. We hail from the same area – British Columbia – but my experience of home was much different. In the conversation, I learned that Jenni was put into foster care in her early teens due to several challenges – housing, mental health supports, etc. While they talk, Louann answers many of her daughter’s unresolved questions about life, loss, love and what led her into foster care.\r\n\r\nBrielle Morgan was the conversation’s facilitator. Brielle is a journalist at Discourse Media, which is C4C’s partner in Vancouver, BC (Check out her journal entries too!). She came out to train our team in May and, with Jenni and Louann’s permission, Brielle trusted their story to us.\r\n\r\nThe team was editing different conversations – myself and Karissa, another C4C member, decided to edit Louann and Jenni’s conversation.\r\n\r\nAnother confession: I had no clue what their story was about at first. I had arrived five minutes late to work (yes, to get a coffee – I’m sorry) I snuck into our morning meeting. I knew we were editing all day but I missed our Director’s description and summary of the conversations. When I sat down at the computer after the meeting, I picked a file at random.\r\n\r\nAnd then I was glued to the computer all day. The conversation between mother and daughter was mesmerizing and powerful.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJenni and Louann talked about their relationship and experiences and the conversation made me question some of my deeper assumptions. And that was <em>their</em> goal. That’s what these women wanted to do. With me, they achieved that tenfold. They shared a journey that was profound, and painful, - but mostly? Inspiring. We’ve never met, and likely never will, but I am grateful for their story.\r\n\r\nDespite having the same original recording, Karissa and I came out of the edit room with different focuses for Jenni and Louann’s story. While at first it presented a challenge, I think, in the end, it strengthened the piece. Together, we crafted a dynamic story that captures Louann and Jenni’s experience - hopefully, as they would have wanted. (As a note: We are hoping to share this story with you soon. Jenni is currently “aging out” of government care so we are waiting to confirm permission from her official caregiver prior to publishing). Other C4C colleagues helped with music selections and gave guidance on the production. Overall, it was a team effort and one which made me understand the nature of this project more. It is going to be about relationships, from start-to-finish, sound-check to story post.\r\n\r\nOf course, there will be light, humorous, down-right-bizarre moments and plenty of joy. But there will also be painful reflections and explorations. We’re really asking people to bare their souls, if they’re willing so that other Canadians can share their journeys and deepen their understanding of life experiences different from their own. And maybe, just maybe, perspectives will shift and minds will change about something. The only thing that comes with that is gratitude, for me.\r\n\r\nIn their conversation, Jenni and Louann mention the idea of “Level 10” – or an excellent, top-notch score it seems. So whatever our “Level 10” might be as a C4C team, I think we should strive for it every day.', 'Why C4C?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '196-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-06-05 21:52:22', '2017-06-05 21:52:22', '', 196, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/196-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;

And we’ve heard from Stephen who shares his experience as a former youth in care both through conversations and his beautiful, reflective artwork.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weeks ahead, we will hear more stories from people who are both affected by the system and actively working to re-imagine it – families, youth, caregivers, social workers, community members. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>With the concerted collaboration of engaged youth and a number of committed partners — C4C and Discourse Media among them — there is a tremendous opportunity to help British Columbia correct its systemic failings and become a leader in the protection and treatment of some of the most vulnerable kids in the country.</strong></span>', 'Barriers', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '275-autosave-v1', '', '', '2017-06-06 17:26:51', '2017-06-06 17:26:51', '', 275, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/275-autosave-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Twenty-seven films were created by filmmaker Colin Low and the community and shared with other communities and government officials. Through the process, the people of Fogo organized and persuaded the government to support a fishing cooperative and marketing board. Together they rebuilt their economy and were able to remain on Fogo Island. </span></p>\r\n<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The<em> Fogo Process</em><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is a beacon for us.

We are creating opportunities for Canadians across the country to talk—to listen—to one another. The conversations are one-on-one between family members, friends, neighbours, travelling companions and total strangers.</span>\r\n\r\nParticipants talk about a whole range of topics--love, loss, belonging, challenges. At times, the topics are completely left up to the participants and other times, questions are suggested or defined through workshops with the community.\r\n\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/220377836\r\n\r\nYou will find the conversations are often deeply personal, emotional, funny. We hope that listening to them is like an experience you may have had in a coffee shop where you’ve stopped checking your feeds or reading your book because the conversation at the next table is so darn interesting. We also hope you learn something too.\r\n\r\nWe facilitate, then record the conversations and create audio-visual media from the ones that resonate most. The media is distributed back into the community and nationally, to a broad audience. All the conversations we record will become part of a national archive available to all Canadians on the National Film Board’s website, NFB.ca\r\n<h2 class="p1">Why Conversations</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to think of a more divisive time in our history. Distrust has been fomented by the Internet which channels us into our echo chambers and is awash in misinformation. Anonymous haters are thriving there, encouraged by politicians who are pitting people and groups against each other. Civil political discourse seems like a notion from another time. </span>\r\n\r\nWe’re in a conversation crisis.\r\n\r\nIf we aren’t talking and listening to each other, we aren’t going to find common ground or solutions to our pressing social challenges.\r\n<h2>Levels of engagement</h2>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">C4C engages with Canadians and communities on a number of levels.</span>\r\n\r\nThe first level is through conversations we are recording on VIA Rail trains and in communities along the way. Our team will be travelling across Canada working with passengers and participants who wish to have their conversations heard.\r\n\r\nThe second level involves deeper engagement with a community. We partner with local organizations and together, design a program to serve their community\'s particular interests and needs. This engagement usually involves workshops, recording and distribution of edited conversations back into the community to provoke deeper conversation.\r\n\r\nThen, where there is need—where there is traction with a community—we continue working with them for a prolonged period of time. The community and local support networks take the lead in what becomes an open-ended process of engagement and media-making to provoke dialogue and advance solutions. Our role is one of support and facilitation based on the belief that communities know what is wrong and they know how to fix it.\r\n\r\n<b>Our current Series is a collaboration with youth in foster care in the Vancouver area.</b>\r\n<h2>Impact</h2>\r\nWe believe listening deeply to each other\'s stories and experiences can build bridges between individuals and communities. It can lead to some or all of the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Deeper understanding of others.</li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A shift in thinking about something (changed minds).</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased sense of belonging or decreased sense of isolation.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse groups working together.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">New relationships fostered.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased, more nuanced discourse about belonging and inclusion.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stronger will to action.</span></li>\r\n 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life is better in tangible ways.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe will know these changes have happened through a combination of surveys, follow-up surveys and metrics.', 'About', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '13-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-06-06 18:09:56', '2017-06-06 18:09:56', '', 13, 'http://107.180.4.90/~c4c156763514/13-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0) ;
